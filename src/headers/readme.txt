The *.header files are used as header in the source files.

They are not registered under CVS in order to prevent CVS from evaluating the CVS tags included. Instead, a gzipped tarred file (headers.tar.gz) is kept under CVS control (In binary form).

It can be expanded with the following command : tar xvfz headers.tar.gz
