        As part of the new usage restrictions which have been placed on the
        SourceForge project shell servers, compilers and other development
        tools are no longer provided.  Cron services have been restored; their
        usage should be restricted to cron jobs which are used to manipulate
        and generate web content for your project.  As it is necessary to
        enforce the usage restrictions on the project shell servers, posting
        of development tools for use on the project shell servers will be
        considered grounds for account removal; those requiring development
        tools should make use of the SourceForge compile farm.  Processes left
        running on the project shell servers will be subject to monitoring and
        termination; operation of IRC bots and other daemon processes is no
        longer permitted.

        The SourceForge.net team has completed the transition of user and group
        data to a new set of high-performance file servers.  This should ease
        the performance and capacity burden previously placed on the project
        shell servers and ensure that the project shell servers meet the
        needs of the growing SourceForge.net user base.  In the event that
        you should have questions or concerns regarding this matter, please
        login to the SourceForge.net site and submit a support request.
