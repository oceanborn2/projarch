<h3>Guide to Generation and Posting of SSH Keys</h3>

<p>When using SSH (Secure SHell) to connect to a remote host, some form of authentication is required.  In the context of SourceForge.net, SSH provides two means to authenticate to a remote host: passwords and the use of public key cryptography (SSH keys).  The use of passwords is fairly well understood; this document has been created to provide an overview of the second supported authentication mechanism, the use of SSH keys.  Included within this document is an overview of the SSH public key mechanisms, instructions for creating a SSH public key pair, and instructions on how to make use of those keys.

<p><br><b><a name="whatisssh">What is SSH?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Secure SHell (SSH) is a protocol and tool suite which provides the means to securely establish interactive sessions, transfer files, and tunnel other protocols (such as CVS).  SSH can be used as a replacement for protocols such as TELNET, FTP and rlogin.  SSH may be used to replace CVS' pserver authentication mechanism, as to provide a more secure means to establish access to a CVS repository.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sshsecurity">What gives SSH more security than other schemes?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Secure SHell (SSH), the protocol, was designed with security in mind.  SSH makes use of cryptographic mechanisms, including public key algorithms (RSA and DSA), ciphers (such as Blowfish and 3des), and cryptographic hash mechanisms (such as MD5 and SHA1).  Cryptography, alone, does not provide security.  Most real-world attacks on protocols have very little to do with cryptographic weaknesses.  The SSH protocols (particularly the SSH2 protocol) have been designed to help prevent common classes of security attacks.  Based on the blatant insecurity of other protocol options (TELNET, FTP, CVS pserver authentication), which transmit data and passwords in-the-clear, SSH provides a significant security improvement.

<p><br><b><a name="sshclient">Where can I get an SSH client?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SSH clients are available for a wide variety of OS platforms and environments.  SourceForge.net maintains a list of our recommendations within the SourceForge.net site document titled, "<a href="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6841&group_id=1">Introduction to SSH on SourceForge.net</a>".
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="username">What username and password do I use when authenticating to a SourceForge.net host?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SourceForge.net makes use of a single sign-on mechanism which covers access to the SourceForge.net web site (via HTTP or HTTPS), project shell servers (via SSH), project CVS servers (via SSH) and the SourceForge.net compile farm (via SSH).  When authenticating to any of these services, you will use the username of your SourceForge.net user account and the password you have set on that user account.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sshtest">How can I easily test to make sure my SSH client is working?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Once you have <a href="#sshclient">selected and installed a SSH client</a>, you may immediately test that client to make sure it is functional.  SourceForge.net offers a number of services which are accessible via SSH.  These services are available only to those SourceForge.net users who are members of active projects hosted on SourceForge.net.

<p>To test your client, the best thing to do is to establish an interactive session to the project shell servers (shell.sourceforge.net).  If you are able to login to shell.sourceforge.net, all other SourceForge.net-provided SSH-based services should also work correctly.

<p>The exact procedure for establishing an interactive login differs from client to client.  Please refer to the documentation accompanying your SSH client suite for assistance.

<p>If you are making use of the <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a> SSH client suite, you may connect to the project shell server by doing the following:
<pre>
  ssh -l username shell.sourceforge.net
</pre>

<p>If you are making use of the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> SSH client suite, you may connect to the project shell server by doing the following:
<ul>
  <li>Execute "PUTTY.EXE"</li>
  <li>Enter "shell.sourceforge.net" in to the "Host Name" field.</li>
  <li>Select the "SSH" radio button in the "Protocol" field.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Open" button.</li>
  <li>Verify the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=3088&group_id=1">key fingerprint</a> for shell.sourceforge.net</li>
  <li>Click "Yes" if the fingerprint matches.</li>
  <li>Enter your SourceForge.net user name at the "login as:" prompt.</li>
  <li>Enter your SourceForge.net password at the "username@shell.sourceforge.net's password:" prompt.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event that you encounter difficulties in connecting to the project shell server in this fashion, please refer to the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting instructions</a> included in this document.

<p><br><b><a name="whatissshkey">What is a SSH key? (a layman's overview)</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
When using SSH to connect to a remote host, some form of authentication is required.  In the context of SourceForge.net, SSH provides two means to authenticate to a remote host: passwords and the use of public key cryptography (SSH keys).  The use of passwords is fairly well understood; this document has been created to provide an overview of the second supported authentication mechanism, the use of SSH keys.

<p>SSH key pairs (as with most mechanisms which use public key cryptography) consist of two pieces, a public key and a private key.  Your private key contains data which only you should know; this key should be retained on a machine you have direct control over and should not be given to anyone.  Your public key will be uploaded to remote hosts to which you wish to connect.

<p>Within public key cryptography, the fundamental idea is that two keys exist, a public key and a private key.  The public key is derived from the private key.  Messages encrypted against the public key may only be decrypted by those individuals who hold the corresponding private key.  Messages signed using the private key may be validated (i.e. you can ensure that the sender holds that private key) using the public key.

<p>Within the SSH key scheme, both the host and the user hold a key pair.  When connecting to the remote host, the public key for that host is sent to the user for verification.  Data sent from the user to the host is encrypted against the public key for that host; when the data is received by the host, it is decrypted using that host's private key.

<p>When you connect to a remote host, it will check to see if it has a public key on file for your account.  If the host does have a public key on file for your account, it will ask your workstation (the connecting machine) whether it holds the corresponding private key.  If your workstation does hold the matching private key, your identity will have been confirmed and you will have completed authentication to the remote host.  Any data subsequently sent from the host to your workstation will be encrypted with your public key (held by the remote host); when that data is received by your workstation, it will be decrypted using your private key.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sshbenefit">What is the benefit of using SSH keys instead of passwords?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
The use of SSH keys for user authentication, instead of passwords, provides a number of significant benefits:
<ul>
 <li>Most SourceForge.net users consider the primary benefit of SSH key use to be the alleviation of the need to enter your password when performing operations (such as CVS commits) which require authentication.</li>
 <li>In order to access your account, an attacker would need to steal your SSH key, not just a short, type-able password.  While it is important to guard access to your SSH private key, it may not easily be written down on scraps of paper near your desk or otherwise be stored in blatantly insecure locations.</li>
 <li>SSH keys are not easily guess-able, alleviating one of the major risks involved with the use and selection of account passwords.</li>
 <li>Since brute force (exhaustive) attacks on SSH keys are much less likely, you may use your SSH keys for a longer time period; passwords need to be changed regularly to ensure a high level of security.</li>
 <li>Using SSH keys, you may easily automate access to a host in a secure manner, since password data need not be stored within the script.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="ssh1vsssh2">What is the difference between SSH1 and SSH2?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SSH comes in two flavors, SSH1 (which uses RSA public key cryptography) and SSH2 (which uses DSA public key cryptography).  SourceForge.net hosts support both SSH1 and SSH2.  We recommend the use of SSH2 rather than SSH1, as result of design enhancements in the newer protocol, though the choice is entirely yours to make.

<p>As stated, SSH1 makes use of RSA public keys and SSH2 makes use of DSA public keys.  These keys are not interchangeable.  The SSH1 and SSH2 protocols function in completely different ways to accomplish similar goals.  While most SSH client suites support both the SSH1 and SSH2 protocols, it is important to realize which protocol you are using, from the perspective of using SSH keys.  The protocol you choose to use will determine what type of public key pair (RSA or DSA) you will generate.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="securityprecaution">What security precautions need to be taken when using SSH keys?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
First and foremost, research the risks related to the use of SSH keys before you decide to make use of these mechanisms.  Understanding how SSH works and the risks involved in key storage will help prepare you to take the proper security precautions.

<p>You should never give out your SSH private key to anyone.  <b>SourceForge.net staff will never ask for your SSH private key data.</b>  It should be realized that only SSH public key data should be posted to remote hosts; private keys are for your local use alone.

<p>SSH private keys may, at time of creation or after they have been created, have a password set on the key.  This password will prevent use of the key until the password has been entered in to your SSH client.  Some applications of SSH keys, such as automated host access by scripts, require the key holder to not set a password on that key.  If you do not have a very good reason for doing this, you should set a password on your key.

<p>The password you set on your SSH key should not match the password set on your SourceForge.net user account.  Passwords should not be shared between different security systems or host networks.  (i.e. you should pick a unique password for use on SourceForge.net and another unique password to protect your SSH key.)

<p>Ensure that your private key has been placed only on machines over which you have direct control.  Public, shared, and community machines are not suitable environments to store SSH private keys.  Take action to help prevent theft of your SSH private key data.  Setting a password on your SSH private key will help reduce the risks involved with private key theft.

<p>Generate a key pair for each major location you work from.  Keep the private key for that location only at that location.  If your private key for a particular location is compromised, simply remove the corresponding public key from SourceForge.net, this preventing further use of that key pair to access SourceForge.net.

<p>If you choose to make a backup of your SSH private key data, please ensure that any such backup is stored in a secure manner.  This should be considered when guarding access to your private key data.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="keygen">How do I generate a SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Each SSH suite provides its own mechanism for key pair generation.  Please refer to the documentation which accompanied your SSH client to determine the proper procedure for adding a password to your key.

<p>If you are making use of <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a>, you will make use of the "ssh-keygen" utility to generate your key pair.  SSH1 (RSA) keys may be generated by executing "ssh-keygen -t rsa1".  SSH2 (DSA) keys may be generated by executing "ssh-keygen -t dsa".  Additional parameters are available; see the documentation accompanying OpenSSH for details.

<p>If you are making use of <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>, a passphrase may be added to your private key file by using the following process:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Execute "PUTTYGEN.EXE"</li>
  <li>Click on the "Generate" button to load an existing private key file.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on-screen (if applicable).</li>
  <li>Enter your new passphrase in to the "Key passphrase" field.</li>
  <li>Enter your new passphrase in to the "Confirm passphrase" field.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Save" button to save your private key file (now protected by your new passphrase).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="keybackup">Backup of SSH key data</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Before considering the backup of your SSH key data, you should first decide whether this is necessary for your particular use of SSH keys.  SourceForge.net hosts will fall back on password authentication, so you will NOT be locked out of these hosts, even if your SSH key(s) are lost.  Before archiving your SSH key data, you should be certain that you have a secure location to store these backups.  To backup your SSH key data, ensure that you have made a copy of your private key data (often stored in ~/.ssh/id_dsa or ~/.ssh/identity).  Security should be the first and last thing you consider when backing up security data.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sfhosts">Which SourceForge.net hosts support the use of SSH keys?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SourceForge.net project shell servers, CVS servers and the compile farm support the use of SSH.  At this time, only the project shell and CVS servers support the use of SSH keys officially.  It should be noted that all services which require the use of SSH are provided solely to those users who are members of active development projects hosted on SourceForge.net.  If you are not a member of an active development project on SourceForge.net, this document does not apply to you (you do not have access to the compile farm, project shell servers, or write access to project CVS servers).
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="keypost">How do I upload a SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SSH public key data may be posted to SourceForge.net using the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/editsshkeys.php">Edit CVS/SSH Shared Keys</a> page, accessible from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/">Account Maintenance page</a>.  SSH key usage is limited to those users who have access to SSH-able hosts.

<p>To upload your SSH key data, cut-and-paste your key data from your <b>public</b> key file (identity.pub, id_dsa.pub, or similar) in to the form on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/editsshkeys.php">Edit CVS/SSH Shared Keys</a> page and make use of the "Update" button on that page.  Once your key data has been posted to SourceForge.net, you will need to <a href="#postdelay">wait up to six hours</a> before your keys will become available for use.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="postdelay">SSH key posting delays</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SourceForge.net has more than 200,000 active user accounts.  To ensure that SSH key data is posted to all hosts in a uniform manner, key data is synchronized to the project shell and project CVS servers every six (6) hours.  While the web interface for your key data will show key changes and additions instantly, it may take up to six hours for your SSH key data to be updated on all applicable hosts.

</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="clientkeyconfig">How do I configure my SSH client to use my SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Once your SSH key pair has been created, some SSH client suites will require additional configuration before the SSH client will actually use that key pair.  For additional details, please refer to the documentation which accompanied your SSH client suite.

<p>If you are making use of the <a href="http://www.openssh">OpenSSH</a> SSH client suite, you generally need not take further action.  If you have used a non-default file name for your key data, you may need to specify the path to this file using the "-i" parameter to the "ssh" program.  For other options, please refer to the OpenSSH documentation.

<p>If you are making use of the <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> SSH client suite, you may configure your SSH client to use your key file by doing the following:
<ul>
  <li>Execute "PUTTY.EXE"</li>
  <li>Enter "shell.sourceforge.net" in to the "Host Name" field.</li>
  <li>Select the "SSH" radio button in the "Protocol" field.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Session - Connection - SSH" tree element in the left portion of the PuTTY Configuration dialog.</li>
  <li>Browse or enter the path to your key file in the "Private key file for authentication" field.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Open" button.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sshprotocol">How do I specify which SSH protocol I wish to use?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
As stated previously, the SSH1 and SSH2 protocols make use of entirely different public key cryptography systems.  Since SSH1 keys will not work with the SSH2 protocol and SSH2 keys will not work with the SSH1 protocol, it is vital that you properly configure your SSH client to make use of the protocol version that matches the keys you intend to use.  Failure to match protocol version to that which matches your SSH keys will result in those keys being ignored.  This is the most common problem that users encounter when trying to key SSH keys working for the first time.

<p>It should also be noted that certain distribution and software upgrades have changed protocol preference during the upgrade process.  If your key is no longer being used (you were using SSH keys, but are now being prompted for a password), check to make sure the protocol preference was not changed without your knowledge.

<p>Protocol selection occurs in different places in different SSH client suites.  If you are making use of the <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a> SSH client suite, you should edit your /etc/ssh/ssh_config file.  Protocol preference is specified within this file in lines similar to the following (the first sets a preference of SSH2 over SSH1, the second sets a preference of SSH1 over SSH2):
<pre>
Protocol 2,1
Protocol 1,2
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="keytest">How can I make sure my SSH key works?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Once you have completed the key generation process and have uploaded your key to the SourceForge.net site, you must observe the six-hour delay in key synchronization to SourceForge.net hosts.  Once this delay has concluded, you may proceed to test the functionality of your key.  If you are making use of OpenSSH or other UNIX-based SSH client, please ensure that you <a href="#sshprotocol">have selected the correct SSH protocol version</a>.

<p>To proceed, <a href="#clientkeyconfig">configure your SSH client to use your SSH key</a>, then establish a connection to "shell.sourceforge.net".  If you are unable to establish a connection to SourceForge.net without entering your SourceForge.net password, or you receive an error message when attempting to connect, please refer to the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting instructions</a> provided in this document.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="keypassadd">Can I put a password on my SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Most SSH suites provide the means to add a password to your private key.  Generally, this may be done either at time of key generation or after-the-fact.  Please refer to the documentation which accompanied your SSH client to determine the proper procedure for adding a password to your key.

<p>If you are making use of <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a>, a passphrase may be added to your private key file using the following command syntax:<br>
<pre>
  ssh-keygen -p [-P old_passphrase] [-N new_passphrase] [-f keyfile]

<p><br><b><a name="keypasschange">Can I remove or change a password on my SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Most SSH suites provide the means to add a password to your private key.  Generally, this may be done either at time of key generation or after-the-fact.  Once a password has been added to your public key file, you may generally remove it, or change it, using the tools provided in your SSH suite.  Please refer to the documentation which accompanied your SSH client to determine the proper procedure for changing or removing a password from your key file.

<p>If you are making use of <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a>, the passphrase on your private key file may be changed using the following command syntax:<br>

</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="sshagent">What is ssh-agent?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
Users of OpenSSH and other UNIX-based SSH clients likely have access to the "ssh-agent" utility.  When you have multiple SSH key pairs or do not wish to enter your SSH key password every time you use SSH, ssh-agent provides a convenient way to manage key data.  ssh-agent will permit you to enter your SSH key file passphrase once, at time of startup, then will act as a proxy when you use any of those keys to access a remote host, thus alleviating the need to enter your SSH key file passphrase again.  The PuTTY SSH client suite includes a similar utility, called Pageant.  Please refer to the documentation accompanying your SSH client suite for further details regarding ssh-agent (or similar).
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="lostkey">What do I do if I lose my SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
The circumstances surrounding the loss or compromise of your SSH key should largely determine your behavior.  If your key is compromised, IMMEDIATELY update your SSH key data on the SourceForge.net site and take steps to ensure your project data has not been compromised (check for changes to project content on the shell servers and CVS commits attributed to your user).  If you have simply lost your key, simply generate a new key pair and update the key data for your user account to match.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="accesswithoutkey">How can I access a SourceForge.net host if I don't have my SSH key?</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
SourceForge.net does not require the use of SSH keys to access SourceForge.net hosts.  In the event that you do not have your SSH private key on hand, SourceForge.net hosts will automatically fall back to the use of your SourceForge.net password for authentication.
</blockquote>


<p><br><b><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting procedure</a></b>
<p><blockquote>
If your attempt to <a href="#sshtest">verify basic SSH connectivity</a> fails:
<ul>
 <li>Check your username and password, then try again.</li>
 <li>Note that usernames and passwords are case-sensitive.</li>
 <li>Some SourceForge.net hosts require that your password contain only letters of the alphabet or numbers; please change your password if this is not already the case.  You may change your password using the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/account/">Account Maintenance</a> page.</li>
 <li>Check the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&group_id=1">SourceForge.net site status page</a> for known issues.</li>
 <li>Ensure that your user account is a member of an active project.  All SourceForge.net services which require SSH usage are provided ONLY to users who are members of active SourceForge.net projects.</li>
 <li>Verify that you are not behind a firewall which could be blocking your traffic.  If you are behind a firewall and require assistance, please contact your network administrator.</li>
 <li>Verify that you can ping "shell.sourceforge.net".  This will help to ensure that connectivity is possible between your workstation and the project shell servers.  If ping fails, please contact your network administrator or wait and try again later.</li>
 <li>If accessing the compile farm, recognize that there may be a delay in password updates.  If you have recently changed your SourceForge.net user account password, that update may take up to 48 hours to appear on the SourceForge.net compile farm.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your attempt to verify SSH key functionality fails
<ul>
 <li>Ensure that you have entered your SSH key file passphrase correctly (if applicable).</li>
 <li>Check your username and try again.</li>
 <li>Check the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&group_id=1">SourceForge.net site status page</a> for known issues.</li>
 <li>Attempt to verify basic SSH connectivity, without using SSH keys (see above).</li>
 <li>Ensure that you have <a href="#postdelay">waited six hours</a> since last uploading key data.</li>
 <li>Verify that your SSH client is <a href="#sshprotocol">using the correct SSH protocol version</a>.</li>
 <li>Verify that you uploaded the right SSH public key.</li>
