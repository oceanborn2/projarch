<H1>Introduction</H1>

No free software or open-source project come from nowhere. We all owe a lot to other free software and open programmers. That is why this page exists. It is basically a (non exhaustive) list of the tools I am using in order to put up this project. 

<H1>Tools list</H1>

<H2>Project hosting</H2>

SourceForge provides open-source programmers with a lot of features developpers need to put up a project (web site, documentation, bug tracking, file releases ...

Probably the best editor in the world, a bit difficult to handle at first but so powerful after some use. I use it for all kinds of programming editing (Perl, Java, HTML ...).

<H2>Programming languages</H2>

<H3>Perl</H3>

One of the most wonderful scripting language. I use it for code generation, all types of administration and automation stuff. Perl can be found at the following link <A href="http://www.perl.com">www.perl.com</A> among others.

<H3>Java</H3>

<H2>Operating system</H2>

<H3>Linux</H3>

An operating system that does work, available to anyone willing to learn what a true operating system is.

<H2>Editors</H2>

<H3>Emacs</H3>

<H3>Lyx</H3>

<H2>More tools to be listed ...</H2>

Some tools have not yet been categorized but this should happen someday.
