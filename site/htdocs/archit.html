<H1>Implementation issues</H1>

The Project Architect uses Java and J2EE as a development platform. We chose this platform both for speed of development and for the huge API that comes with it.

On the other hand, it has been decided to use code generation in order to enforce consistent coding guidelines (on top of a framework) and to speed up development. 

I am currently investigating this issue using <A HREF="http://www.perl.com">perl</A> and <A HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.com">The Template Toolkit</A>

<H1>Deployment issues</H1>

The main advantages of using J2EE are the following : 
<ul>
  <li>Large API collections : Lots of features and consistency of development</li>
  <li>Scalable : By using an application server like <A HREF="http://www.jboss.org">Jboss</A></li>
</ul>
